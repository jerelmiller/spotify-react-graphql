# Spotify React + GraphQL

Web player for the Spotify Web and Connect APIs. I wanted to play around with
Apollo Server by using it on top of an established REST API.

**client**

The frontend React app powered by Apollo.

**server**

The backend Apollo server. This layers a GraphQL API on top of the Spotify APIs.
